# Welcome to Dragond!

- NOTE: THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!! BUT MANY MORE FEATURES WILL BE APPLIED IN THE NEAR FUTURE!

Dragond is a open source web application development designed for you nerdy nerds who want a niche solution to rpg character generation.

Dragond will allow you to generate an rpg character using a quick variety of user-friendly drop-down menus, questions, and selections
(Alternatively, you can input nothing at all! Leave it all to chance!)

Currently Dragond uses the 2024 ruleset provided in its respective player's handbook only. The goal is to include more content ex. most recently the eberron and faerun content.

The application uses render for the backend (https://dragond-3a3i.onrender.com) and vercel for the frontend (https://dragond.vercel.app/) <-- check out the website here!

Dragond will support the following tabletop rpg editions:
- D&D 5e (2024)
